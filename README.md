### Data and plotting scripts for figures in the main text and supplementary information

Each folder contains the input data generated from the MD simulations, the python script used to generate the corresponding plot, and the final png image as wellas the initial and the final structures. Each data file has a header that describes each column in the file. 

Statistical analyses including mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc. calculated within the python scripts based on the input data files. <br> 
**Note: There are two MD paramater files 'grompp.mdp' and 'simpar.ark'. grompp.mdp was used for short equilibration in gromacs whereas the 'simpar.ark' was used to run the production run in Anton2 computing facilities.
